I kept my mouth            quietly, cry whole heartedly and love silently. It   shut and started staring at the ceiling and the            was a Thursday night. I was sitting simply in my     doors .There was nothing suspicious .I got            chair for hours laughing and crying for myself.      scared and switched on all lights and started  Jilu Prakash  (I am not out of mind).Unexpectedly I found out   studying .I could not concentrate and was  S4 EE     a crumpled piece of paper inside my drawer. It       crying. I don’t remember the exact time I went            was addressed to Mr. Tom.                            to sleep .Still when I woke up in morning the            Tom was a name I was not familiar with and           letter was the biggest question in my mind .I                                                                 went to college and surprisingly the exam got            I was pretty sure that the paper wasn’t there            2 hours before. Who would do such a thing? I         postponed. I suddenly remembered the con-                                                                 tents of the letters. Oh my god its real! I grew  Mr.TOM    .I felt something queer .Is it some supernatural     fled to home. I took all the letters in my hand            thought deeply. My sister was not at home and                                                                 more and more interested in the letter and            my parents never bothered to check my drawer                                                                 and started to read them one by one:            occurrence? I started reading it .Suddenly the                                                                 Mr. Tom,            lights went out...

Days later I saw another letter            addressed to Mr. Tom in the same place. The            first thing I did was running to find the other                                                                 senselessly that day I ask  pardon  for            piece of paper but I couldn’t find it .I settled     nothing to do with her .She was talking            down to read the new letter.
